Converting the pressure sensor readings from four corners to x, y coordinates involves using a technique called centroid calculation. The centroid is the geometric center of a planar shape, and it can be calculated by averaging the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the points that define the shape.

In this case, the four pressure sensors define a rectangular shape with the centroid at the center. The pressure sensor readings can be used to calculate the relative positions of the sensors with respect to the centroid. Then, the relative positions can be converted to x, y coordinates by using a scaling factor.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the math involved:

Normalize sensor readings: Normalize the sensor readings by dividing each reading by the sum of all readings. This ensures that the normalized readings represent the relative contribution of each sensor to the overall force.

Calculate relative positions: Calculate the relative positions of the sensors with respect to the centroid. This can be done by multiplying the normalized readings by the distance between the corresponding sensor and the centroid.

Convert relative positions to x, y coordinates: Convert the relative positions to x, y coordinates by using a scaling factor. The scaling factor represents the conversion between the units of the relative positions (e.g., centimeters) and the units of the desired x, y coordinates (e.g., meters).

Here is an example of how to implement this process in Python:
"""

import numpy as np

def calculate_centroid(sensor_readings, sensor_positions):
    # Normalize sensor readings
    normalized_readings = sensor_readings / np.sum(sensor_readings)

    # Calculate relative positions
    relative_positions = np.dot(normalized_readings, sensor_positions)

    return relative_positions

def convert_relative_positions_to_coordinates(relative_positions, scaling_factor):
    # Convert relative positions to coordinates
    coordinates = relative_positions * scaling_factor

    return coordinates

# Example usage
sensor_readings = [10, 20, 30, 40]
sensor_positions = np.array([[1, 1], [-1, 1], [-1, -1], [1, -1]])
scaling_factor = 0.1

centroid = calculate_centroid(sensor_readings, sensor_positions)
coordinates = convert_relative_positions_to_coordinates(centroid, scaling_factor)

print("Centroid:", centroid)
print("Coordinates:", coordinates)
